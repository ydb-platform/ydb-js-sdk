# @ydbjs/retry

## 6.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#560](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-js-sdk/pull/560) [`9123c13`](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb-js-sdk/commit/9123c13199871cb994ce146ccc2e83c2edf10399) Thanks [@polRk](https://github.com/polRk)! - Fix topic reader/writer disconnecting after Discovery.listEndpoints

  When the driver refreshed its endpoint pool on a periodic discovery round,
  it closed and recreated gRPC channels for all known nodes. This caused active
  bidirectional streams (topic reader / writer) to receive a `CANCELLED` gRPC
  status, which was not treated as a retryable error — so the streams terminated
  instead of reconnecting.

  Changes:
  - **`@ydbjs/retry`**: added `isRetryableStreamError` and `defaultStreamRetryConfig`.
    Long-lived streaming RPCs should reconnect on `CANCELLED` and `UNAVAILABLE`
    in addition to the errors already handled by `isRetryableError`, because for
    streams those codes indicate a transport interruption rather than a semantic
    cancellation.
  - **`@ydbjs/topic`**: reader (`_consume_stream`) and both writers (`writer`,
    `writer2`) now use `isRetryableStreamError` / `defaultStreamRetryConfig` so
    they transparently reconnect after a discovery-triggered channel replacement.
    Fixed a zombie-reader bug where `read()` would block forever if the retry
    budget was exhausted: the reader is now destroyed on unrecoverable stream
    errors so pending `read()` calls are unblocked immediately.
